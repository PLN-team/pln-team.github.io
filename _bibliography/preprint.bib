	abstract = {Inferring parameters of a latent variable model can be a daunting task when the conditional distribution of the latent variables given the observed ones is intractable. Variational approaches prove to be computationally efficient but, possibly, lack theoretical guarantees on the estimates, while sampling based solutions are quite the opposite. Starting from already available variational approximations, we define a first Monte Carlo EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimators, focusing on the Poisson log-normal model which provides a generic framework for the analysis of multivariate count data. We then extend this algorithm to the case of a composite likelihood in order to be able to handle higher dimensional count data.}

	abstract = {Interactions between plant pathogens and other plant-associated microorganisms regulate disease. Deciphering the networks formed by these interactions, termed pathobiomes, is crucial to disease management. Our aim was to investigate whether microbial association networks inferred from metabarcoding data give relevant insights into pathobiomes, by testing whether inferred associations contain signals of ecological interactions. We used Poisson Lognormal Models to construct microbial association networks from metabarcoding data and then investigated whether some of these associations corresponded to interactions measurable in co-cultures or known in the literature, by using grapevine (Vitis vinifera) and the fungal pathogen causing powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator) as a model system. Our model suggested that the pathogen species was associated with 23 other fungal species, forming its putative pathobiome. These associations were not known as interactions in the literature, but one of them was confirmed by our co-culture experiments. The yeast Buckleyzyma aurantiaca impeded pathogen growth and reproduction, in line with the negative association found in the microbial network. Co-cultures also supported another association involving two yeast species. Together, these findings indicate that microbial networks can provide plausible hypotheses of ecological interactions that could be used to develop microbiome-based strategies for crop protection.}

                ecology and accident analysis to single-cell RNA sequencing
                (scRNA-seq) and metagenomics. While log transformations are
                computationally efficient, mo\-del-based approaches such as the
                Poisson-Log-Normal (PLN) model provide robust statistical
                foundations and are more amenable to extensions. The PLN model,
                with its latent Gaussian structure, not only captures
                overdispersion but also enables correlation between variables
                and inclusion of covariates, making it suitable for
                multivariate count data analysis. Variational approximations
                are a golden standard to estimate parameters of complex latent
                variable models such as PLN, maximizing a surrogate likelihood.
                However, variational estimators lack theoretical statistical
                properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality. In
                this paper, we investigate the consistency and variance
                estimation of PLN parameters using M-estimation theory. We
                derive the Sandwich estimator, previously studied in
                \cite{sandwich}, specifically for the PLN model. We compare
                this approach to the variational Fisher Information method,
                demonstrating the Sandwich estimator’s effectiveness in terms
                of coverage through simulation studies. Finally, we validate
                our method on a scRNA-seq dataset.},

      abstract={High-dimensional count data poses significant challenges for statistical
    analysis, necessitating effective methods that also preserve
    explainability. We focus on a low rank constrained variant of the Poisson
    log-normal model, which relates the observed data to a latent low-dimensional
    multivariate Gaussian variable via a Poisson distribution. Variational
    inference methods have become a golden standard solution to infer such a
    model. While computationally efficient, they usually lack theoretical
    statistical properties with respect to the model. To address this issue we
    propose a projected stochastic gradient scheme that directly maximizes the
    log-likelihood. We prove the convergence of the proposed method when using
    importance sampling for estimating the gradient. Specifically, we obtain a
    rate of convergence of $O(T^{\nicefrac{-1}{2}} + N^{-1})$ with $T$ the
    number of iterations and $N$ the number of Monte Carlo draws. The latter
    follows from a novel descent lemma for non convex $L$-smooth objective
    functions, and random biased gradient estimate. We also demonstrate
    numerically the efficiency of our solution compared to its variational
    competitor. Our method not only scales with respect to the number of
    observed samples but also provides access to the desirable properties of
    the maximum likelihood estimator.},
