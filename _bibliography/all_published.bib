  ABSTRACT =	 {Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDM) provide a
                  general multivariate framework to study the joint
                  abundances of all species from a community. JSDM
                  account for both structuring factors (environmental
                  characteristics or gradients, such as habitat type
                  or nutrient availability) and potential interactions
                  between the species (competition, mutualism,
                  parasitism, etc.), which is instrumental in
                  disentangling meaningful ecological interactions
                  from mere statistical associations. Modeling the
                  dependency between the species is challenging
                  because of the count-valued nature of abundance data
                  and most JSDM rely on Gaussian latent layer to
                  encode the dependencies between species in a
                  covariance matrix. The multivariate
                  Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model is one such model,
                  which can be viewed as a multivariate mixed Poisson
                  regression model. Inferring such models raises both
                  statistical and computational issues, many of which
                  were solved in recent contributions using
                  variational techniques and convex optimization
                  tools. The PLN model turns out to be a versatile
                  framework, within which a variety of analyses can be
                  performed, including multivariate sample comparison,
                  clustering of sites or samples, dimension reduction
                  (ordination) for visualization purposes, or
                  inferring interaction networks. This paper presents
                  the general PLN framework and illustrates its use on
                  a series a typical experimental datasets. All the
                  models and methods are implemented in the

  abstract = {The problem of network reconstruction from continuous data has been extensively studied and
most state of the art methods rely on variants of Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM). GGM are unfortunately badly suited to sparse count data spanning several orders of magnitude. Most inference methods for count data (SparCC, REBACCA, SPIEC-EASI, gCoda, etc) first transform counts to pseudo-Gaussian observations before using GGM. We rely instead on a PoissonLogNormal (PLN) model where counts follow Poisson distributions with parameters sampled from a latent multivariate Gaussian variable, and infer the network in the latent space using a variational inference procedure. This model allows us to (i) control for confounding covariates and differences in sampling efforts and (ii) integrate data sets from different origins. It is also competitive in terms of speed and accuracy with state of the art methods.},

  abstract = {Many application domains, such as ecology or genomics, have to deal with multivariate non-Gaussian observations. A typical example is the joint observation of the respective abundances of a set of species in a series of sites aiming to understand the covariations between these species. The Gaussian setting provides a canonical way to model such dependencies but does not apply in general. We consider here the multivariate exponential family framework for which we introduce a generic model with multivariate Gaussian latent variables. We show that approximate maximum likelihood inference can be achieved via a variational algorithm for which gradient descent easily applies. We show that this setting enables us to account for covariates and offsets. We then focus on the case of the Poisson-lognormal model in the context of community ecology. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm on microbial ecology datasets. We illustrate the importance of accounting for the effects of covariates to better understand interactions between species.},

  abstract =	 {Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and
                  veterinary importance, and represent an increasing
                  threat for human and animal health. Important steps
                  in assessing disease risk and developing possible
                  new future control strategies involve identifying
                  tick-borne microbes, their temporal dynamics and
                  interactions.Methods Using high throughput
                  sequencing, we studied the microbiota dynamics of
                  Ixodes ricinus from 371 nymphs collected monthly
                  over three consecutive years in a peri-urban
                  forest. After adjusting a Poisson Log Normal model
                  to our data set, the implementation of a principal
                  component analysis as well as sparse network
                  reconstruction and differential analysis allowed us
                  to assess inter-annual, seasonal and monthly
                  variability of I. ricinus microbial communities as
                  well as their interactions.Results Around 75\% of
                  the detected sequences belonged to five genera known
                  to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods
                  and potentially circulating in ticks: Candidatus
                  Midichloria, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Arsenophonus
                  and Wolbachia. The structure of the I. ricinus
                  microbiota was temporally variable with interannual
                  recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs
                  belonging to environmental genera. The total network
                  analysis revealed a majority of positive (partial)
                  correlations. We identified strong relationships
                  between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and
                  Arsenophonus, betraying the presence of the
                  parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks, and
                  the well known arthropod symbiont Spiroplasma,
                  previously documented to be involved in the defense
                  against parasitoid wasp in Drosophila
                  melanogaster. Other associations were observed
                  between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and
                  pathogens belonging to Rickettsia, probably
                  Rickettsia helvetica. More specific network analysis
                  finally suggested that the presence of pathogens
                  belonging to genera Borrelia, Anaplasma and
                  Rickettsia might disrupt microbial interactions in
                  I. ricinus.Conclusions Here, we identified the
                  I. ricinus microbiota and documented for the first
                  time the existence and recurrence of marked temporal
                  shifts in the tick microbial community dynamics. We
                  statistically showed strong relationships between
                  the presence of some pathogens and the structure of
                  the I. ricinus non-pathogenic microbes. We
                  interestingly detected close links between some tick
                  symbionts and the potential presence of either
                  pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks. All
                  these new findings might be very promising for the
                  future development of new control strategies of
                  ticks and tick-borne diseases.Competing Interest

    abstract = "{An exhaustive analysis was performed on more than 2000 microbiotas from French Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses, covering most cheese families produced throughout the world. Thanks to a complete and accurate set of associated metadata, we have carried out a deep analysis of the ecological drivers of microbial communities in milk and ‚Äúterroir‚Äù cheeses. We show that bacterial and fungal microbiota from milk differed significantly across dairy species while sharing a core microbiome consisting of four microbial species. By contrast, no microbial species were detected in all ripened cheese samples. Our network analysis suggested that the cheese microbiota was organized into independent network modules. These network modules comprised mainly species with an overall relative abundance lower than 1\%, showing that the most abundant species were not those with the most interactions. Species assemblages differed depending on human drivers, dairy species, and geographical area, thus demonstrating the contribution of regional know-how to shaping the cheese microbiota. Finally, an extensive analysis at the milk-to-cheese batch level showed that a high proportion of cheese taxa were derived from milk under the influence of the dairy species and protected designation of origin.}",
