  abstract =	 {The relative importance of ecological factors and
                  species interactions for phytophagous insect species
                  distributions has long been a controversial
                  issue. Using field abundances of eight sympatric
                  Tephritid fruit flies on 21 host plants, we inferred
                  flies{\textquoteright} realized niches using joint
                  species distribution modelling and network
                  inference, on the community as a whole and
                  separately on three groups of host plants. These
                  inferences were then confronted to
                  flies{\textquoteright} fundamental niches estimated
                  through laboratory-measured fitnesses on host
                  plants. Species abundances were mainly determined by
                  host plants followed by climatic factors, with a
                  minor role for competition between species sharing
                  host plants. The relative importance of these
                  factors mildly changed when we focused on particular
                  host plant groups. Despite overlapping fundamental
                  niches, specialists and generalists had almost
                  distinct realized niches, with possible competitive
                  exclusion of generalists by specialists on
                  Cucurbitaceae and different assembly rules:
                  specialists were mainly influenced by their
                  adaptation to host plants while generalist
                  abundances varied regardless of their fundamental

  abstract =	 {Background Ticks transmit pathogens of medical and
                  veterinary importance, and represent an increasing
                  threat for human and animal health. Important steps
                  in assessing disease risk and developing possible
                  new future control strategies involve identifying
                  tick-borne microbes, their temporal dynamics and
                  interactions.Methods Using high throughput
                  sequencing, we studied the microbiota dynamics of
                  Ixodes ricinus from 371 nymphs collected monthly
                  over three consecutive years in a peri-urban
                  forest. After adjusting a Poisson Log Normal model
                  to our data set, the implementation of a principal
                  component analysis as well as sparse network
                  reconstruction and differential analysis allowed us
                  to assess inter-annual, seasonal and monthly
                  variability of I. ricinus microbial communities as
                  well as their interactions.Results Around 75\% of
                  the detected sequences belonged to five genera known
                  to be maternally inherited bacteria in arthropods
                  and potentially circulating in ticks: Candidatus
                  Midichloria, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Arsenophonus
                  and Wolbachia. The structure of the I. ricinus
                  microbiota was temporally variable with interannual
                  recurrence and seemed to be mainly driven by OTUs
                  belonging to environmental genera. The total network
                  analysis revealed a majority of positive (partial)
                  correlations. We identified strong relationships
                  between OTUs belonging to Wolbachia and
                  Arsenophonus, betraying the presence of the
                  parasitoid wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri in ticks, and
                  the well known arthropod symbiont Spiroplasma,
                  previously documented to be involved in the defense
                  against parasitoid wasp in Drosophila
                  melanogaster. Other associations were observed
                  between the tick symbiont Candidatus Midichloria and
                  pathogens belonging to Rickettsia, probably
                  Rickettsia helvetica. More specific network analysis
                  finally suggested that the presence of pathogens
                  belonging to genera Borrelia, Anaplasma and
                  Rickettsia might disrupt microbial interactions in
                  I. ricinus.Conclusions Here, we identified the
                  I. ricinus microbiota and documented for the first
                  time the existence and recurrence of marked temporal
                  shifts in the tick microbial community dynamics. We
                  statistically showed strong relationships between
                  the presence of some pathogens and the structure of
                  the I. ricinus non-pathogenic microbes. We
                  interestingly detected close links between some tick
                  symbionts and the potential presence of either
                  pathogenic Rickettsia or a parasitoid in ticks. All
                  these new findings might be very promising for the
                  future development of new control strategies of
                  ticks and tick-borne diseases.Competing Interest

  abstract =	 {Biomonitoring ecosystems is necessary in order to
                  evaluate risks and to efficiently manage ecosystems
                  and their associated services. Agrosystems are the
                  target of multiple stressors that can affect many
                  species through effects cascading along food
                  webs. However, classic biomonitoring, focused on
                  species diversity or indicator species, might be a
                  poor predictor of the risk of such whole-ecosystem
                  perturbations. Thanks to high-throughput sequencing
                  methods, however, it might be possible to obtain
                  sufficient information about entire ecological
                  communities to infer the functioning of their
                  associated interaction networks, and thus monitor
                  more closely the risk of the collapse of entire food
                  webs due to external stressors. In the course of the
                  ‘next-generation biomonitoring’ project, we
                  collectively sought to experiment with this idea of
                  inferring ecological networks on the basis of
                  metabarcoding information gathered on different
                  systems. We here give an overview of issues and
                  preliminary results associated with this endeavour
                  and highlight the main difficulties that such
                  next-generation biomonitoring is still facing. Going
                  from sampling protocols up to methods for comparing
                  inferred networks, through biomolecular,
                  bioinformatic, and network inference, we review all
                  steps of the process, with a view towards generality
                  and transferability towards other systems.},
