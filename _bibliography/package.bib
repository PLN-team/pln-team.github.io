    abstract={High dimensional count data are complex to analyze as is, and normalization must be performed,
but standard normalization does not fit the characteristics of count data. The Poisson-Log
Normal (PLN) (Aitchison & Ho, 1989) and its Principal Component Analysis variant PLN-PCA
(Chiquet et al., 2018) are two-sided latent variable models allowing both suitable normalization
and analysis of multivariate count data, implemented in this package.},
