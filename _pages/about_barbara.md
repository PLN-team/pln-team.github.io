Barbara Bricout is pursuing her doctoral studies in the field of
statistics applied to ecological sciences, with guidance from Stephane Robin,
Sophie Donnet, and the Tour du Valat. The primary focus of her research is to
address the challenge of imputing missing data in waterbird count data within
the context of North Africa. Specifically, she aims to expand the application
of the Poisson Log-Normal (PLN) model to accommodate data characterized by
multidimensional covariates, significant overdispersion, and an abundance of
zero values.
