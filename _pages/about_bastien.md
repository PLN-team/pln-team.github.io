<a href="https://bastien-mva.github.io/">Bastien Batardiere</a>  is currently pursuing a PhD in Statistical Learning under the
guidance of <a href="https://jchiquet.github.io">Julien Chiquet</a>. His
research is centered around expanding the PLN model to handle extensive
datasets, with a specific emphasis on its adaptation for high-dimensional
single-cell RNA data. Given the prevalence of zero values in this type of data,
he is concurrently investigating a zero-inflated version of the PLN model. The
outcomes of his research are incorporated into the <a href="https://github.com/PLN-team/pyPLNmodels">pyPLNmodels</a> package.
Additionally, Bastien is delving into the theoretical guarantees associated
with PLN models.
