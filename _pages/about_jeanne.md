Jeanne Tous is a PhD student working under the supervision of Julien
Chiquet and Wilfried Thuiller. She works on developing PLN-block, an
extension of PLN-network that would account for potential group structures
in the inferred networks. Her research focuses on applications to ecology
and the study of biodiversity in order to enhance our vision of species
association networks evolution through the observation of such group
structures.
